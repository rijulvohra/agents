    "1. Visit https://huggingface.co and set up an account  \n",
    "2. From the Avatar menu on the top right, choose Access Tokens. Choose \"Create New Token\". Give it WRITE permissions - it needs to have WRITE permissions! Keep a record of your new key.  \n",
    "3. In the Terminal, run: `uv tool install 'huggingface_hub[cli]'` to install the HuggingFace tool, then `hf auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`, like `hf auth login --token hf_xxxxxx`, to login at the command line with your key. Afterwards, run `hf auth whoami` to check you're logged in  \n",
