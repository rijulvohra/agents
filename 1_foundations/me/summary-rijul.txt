\f0\fs24 \cf0 My name is Rijul Vohra. I'm a software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from New Delhi, India, but I moved to Los Angeles, CA in 2019 for my Masters in Data Science from University of Southern California and then moved to NYC to work with Jefferies as a Knowledge Graph Engineer.\
I love all foods, particularly Indian food. I have a huge sweet tooth and love sweets specially chocolate based, like a chocolate ice cream or chocolate cake.}
